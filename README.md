# Simple Painter Application

Simple Painter Application is a C# Windows Forms library-based program that can generate SVG files. With the help of the program's user-friendly interface, users will be able to create and alter images using a variety of tools, including shapes, colors, brushes, and lines. 

Features:
- Draw shapes like ellipse, rectangle, square, circle, line and freeform with different stroke width, stroke color, and fill color, with an option to select "Filled" <br>
- Main menu with shortcut keys for File (new, open, save, save as, exit), Edit (undo, redo, clear all, select, delete), View (In Browser, XML Format, About) <br>
- Picture control to display the image being created <br>
- Ruler and guideline feature <br>
- Option to choose a background color <br>
- Fun button that generates random shapes with random colors and size <br>
- Mouse and keyboard interaction support <br>
- Save and recover work in progress <br>
- Selection capability to change properties or delete visual elements <br>
- Undo/Redo functionality <br>

Known Bugs: <br>
The Open feature in File Menu does not open svg files. 

Future Plans: <br>
While the project has been completed, there is always room for improvement. There will be ongoin improvement in the known bug. In the future, third-party libraries can be incorporated, and a strong data structure can be created to manage the SVG files, helping to overcome the difficulties of incorporating additional capabilities.
