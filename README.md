# Simple Painter Application

Simple Painter Application is a C# Windows Forms library-based program that can generate SVG files. With the help of the program's user-friendly interface, users will be able to create and alter images using a variety of tools, including shapes, colors, brushes, and lines. 

Features:
Draw shapes like ellipse, rectangle, square, circle, line and freeform with different stroke width, stroke color, and fill color, with an option to select "Filled"
Main menu with shortcut keys for File (new, open, save, save as, exit), Edit (undo, redo, clear all, select, delete), View (In Browser, XML Format, About)
Picture control to display the image being created
Ruler and guideline feature
Option to choose a background color
Fun button that generates random shapes with random colors and size
Mouse and keyboard interaction support
Save and recover work in progress
Selection capability to change properties or delete visual elements
Undo/Redo functionality

Future Plans:
While the project has been completed, there is always room for improvement. In the future, third-party libraries can be incorporated, and a strong data structure can be created to manage the SVG files, helping to overcome the difficulties of incorporating additional capabilities.
